# Rotamers-Clustering
Study of GSK3 active site and clustering approaches

This repository contains the semester team project for the Data Science & Information Technologies masters course:Algorithms in Structural Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) during the Spring 2023 semester

# Abstract
This research focuses on exploring the active sites of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) kinases, which play a crucial role in enzyme function and have implications for drug development. We compare the performance of two advanced prediction tools in identifying GSK3 binding sites namely Deep Pocket and P2rank, using known binding sites from the literature as a benchmark. Our computational pipeline is based on the previous work of Kostantina Roka and generates all the possible conformations of the binding site of a specific protein given its active site, a set of pdb strucures and the pdb files of the amino acid rotamers. Clustering algorithms are then applied to analyze and identify structural patterns within the conformations. By following this systematic approach, our study aims to enhance our understanding of GSK3 active sites and contribute to future drug design endeavors in the field of enzymology.
